This app is server and client at the same time. This is a test programm and the code will be implemented in my desktop applications to allow IPC (interproccess communication).

## Usage 
1. Open Multiple Instances on the same computer
2. Click *Start Server*
3. Enter a Message
4. Click *Send Message*
5. The Message is echoed from the other servers
